            <div class="text">
                <p>Villa Plaza is a constructive building agency that helps assign new business owners advantageous
                    establishments. I asked Angelica, the owner (and family member), five questions. Two questions
                    focused on
                    the design aspects, the inclusion choice of color, and competitive designs; the remaining three
                    concentrated
                    on the business's long and short-term missions. Initially, I started the sketches by connecting the
                    available buildings in the plaza with sleek modern typography. No color was in mind when drawing the
                    sketches, only focusing on achieving a contemporary design. Once I decided on the logo to continue,
                    I
                    started using Adobe Illustrator to construct the shapes in the V. Capturing the essence of
                    repetition,
                    proximity, and alignment as the shapes decreased in size. Typography: Inspired by the sleek text
                    shapes of
                    the album cover, Blond, designed by Wolfgang Tillmans, yet not using an italic shape, keeps
                    boldness.
                    Lastly, Angelica presented a choice of two colors: walnut and copper. I presented both and had her
                    pick
                    which one she liked the most.

                    Although the logo's success prominence aided in cards, posters, ads, and billboard designs, the
                    completion
                    of the project should’ve presented with more compassion. Angelica’s design team followed with
                    spacing
                    issues
                    in PLAZA, and the a in Villa contorted after post-design in Photoshop (likely due to conversion
                    of SVG
                    to
                    JPG). The contortion and spacing issue was resolved with further tweaking. Furthermore, I was
                    not aware
                    of
                    how the branding presentation of a logo should also be accommodated with conceptual designs such
                    as
                    suggested color schemes, variations of the logo when presented on a card or poster, exact
                    typography to
                    aid
                    the design team, and other marketing constructs (merch, banners, etc.). However, the experience
                    will not
                    go
                    to waste, and Angelica was delighted with the Villa Plaza logo design.
